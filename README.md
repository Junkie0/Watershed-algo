# Interactive Image Segmentation Tool

This repository contains a Python script that implements an interactive image segmentation tool using OpenCV. The tool allows users to segment images by drawing markers on areas of interest, leveraging the watershed algorithm. Each marker acts as a seed point for segmentation.

## Features:

- Interactive marker placement: Users can place markers on the image using the mouse.
- Marker colors: Users can choose from a variety of colors for differentiating regions.
- Real-time segmentation: The tool provides real-time feedback on segmentation as markers are placed.
- Reset and clear options: Users can reset the segmentation or clear markers with simple key commands.

## Requirements:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
